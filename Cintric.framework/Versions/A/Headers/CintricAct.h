/**
 Create a goal to track whether a user goes to a location or not within some time span.
 You can track goal conversion rates and details on the web panel.
 
 For example, you may want to track what percent of users go to a POI within a week, after viewing it on a map.
 Each time the user views a POI you call setGoalConversionForCoordinate and it will automatically be tracked by the server.
 Use the name to differentiate types of goals, you might call this one "POI Conversion".
 
 You can then see the conversion rates of all users who have a goal called "POI Conversion".
 You may want to use the tags to filter and sort your goals. Perhaps if the POI is a restaurant have a tag "restaurant".
 
 The purpose of the unique ID is so that duplicate goals are not created for the same user.
 You may want to use a different unique ID for each POI, but any time the user views the same POI use the same unique ID.
 This will update the goal that was previously set with that unique ID. Unique IDs only have to be unique per user.
 A good choice for your unique id would be the unique id of the POI the user is viewing.
 
 In this example, you would set the startTime as the current time, and the endTime as the current time + one week.
 Then use the coordinate for your POI, and a radius depending on the size of the POI in interest.
 If you donâ€™t have a clear idea for your radius size, a good default choice is 50 (radius is in meters).
 
 @param coord     The lat lon coordinate of the goal destination
 @param radius    The radius in meters, how far from the coordinate counts as a conversion. 50 is a good default.
 @param startTime The time for the start of your goal. If a user goes to the location before this date, it does not count as a conversion. A good default is [NSDate date].
 @param endTime   The end time for your goal to count as a conversion. This is important to see how many people do not complete the goal.
 @param name      The name of your goal. This is used to aggregate and sort similar goals on the web panel
 @param tags      NSArray of NSString. Tags are used to sort and filter goals on the web panel.
 @param uniqueId  A unique NSString. Using the same unique id for a goal for the same user will update the parameters of the goal rather than creating a new one.
